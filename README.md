## [DEMO LINK](https://2pasha.github.io/inforce-task)

version on the demo was implemented by storing information in `localStorage` to show the working version of the demo.

- here is the implementation with `json-server` [link](https://github.com/2pasha/inforce-task/tree/0e65833fd8854b67fe616e727ff2af2f230dd9d2)
- I did not have enough time to implement the option of storing data in the database, if you give me more time, I will be able to implement it
